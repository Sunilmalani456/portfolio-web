        I am a frontend developer working as freelancer and I am constantly
        looking for ground-breaking solutions to issues that arise in daily
        life. In my work, I spend most of my time coming up with innovative
        solutions to development problems. (That's not entirely true, I just
        enjoy creating fun experiences on the web but let's keep it
        professionalüôÇ).

        I've been a part of this industry for over two years and within those
        years, I've honed my analytic and collaboration skills which makes
        working with a team easier. I've also had the opportunity to serve as
        lead software engineer for different projects.

        I enjoy watching anime and I am very into the Marvel franchise. I listen
        to lots of music, James Blake, Fujii Kaze and Isak Danielson are some of
        my favourite artists (for now). I spend most of my free time with my
        family and my dog üêï or watching movies.
